SOURCE:

The dataset was created by Athanasios Tsanas (tsanasthanasis '@' gmail.com) of the University of Oxford, extracting clinical information from speech signals which were provided by LSVT Global, a company specialising in voice rehabilitation. The original study used 309 algorithms to characterize 126 speech signals from 14 people, a robust feature selection mechanism to determine the most parsimonious feature subset, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF) to predict the binary response (acceptable vs unacceptable phonation during rehabilitation). Both cross-validation (10-fold cross validation with 100 repetitions for statistical confidence) and leave one subject out methods were used for the validation of the findings. In both cases we denostrated a near 90% accurate replication of the clinicians' assessment.

DATA SET INFORMATION:

This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical speech signal processing algorithms from 14 people who have been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease undergoing LSVT (a program assisting voice rehabilitation). 

The Excel file has three sheets: the first sheet, 'Data', contains the dataset (design matrix). The second sheet, 'Binary response', contains the response (target) we aim to replicate. The third sheet, 'Participant demographics', contains general demographics (participant id, age and gender).
Each row in the design matrix corresponds to one of 126 voice recordings. 

The aim is to use the 309 features to predict the binary response. For further information please contact Athanasios
